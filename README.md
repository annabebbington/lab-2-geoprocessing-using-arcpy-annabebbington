# LAB 2: GEOPROCESSING USING ArcPy
Due: 30 October 2020

##  WHAT TO SUBMIT
You will submit a link to your Github repo via Moodle. You will need to create your own `.py` files for the repo. *Be sure they all contain good comment headers!* Your repo should contain:
- one script with comments and 
- one screenshot of your final map, displayed in your README.

Your README should explain briefly what you did in the lab and clearly list the contents of the repo and explain what it is so that someone who is not in the class can look at your repo and understand both the lab and the outputs. In example, “file.flooding.py is a Python script for use in ArcMap. The script takes some inputs and then outputs something else…” For guidance on things you should include in your readme, or how to structure it nicely using markdown, [see this web page](https://www.makeareadme.com/). 

If you need a refresher for adding images to your Github repo, see [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHbWF1Bvgf4) or [this README in my personal repo](https://github.com/Shadrock/code-snippets).
